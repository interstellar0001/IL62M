# Project IL62 - Ilyushin 62M
  This aircraft is developed from the unfinished, open-source RuPlanes IL62M.

# Update Feb. 2026 - Help needed!
  After a huge data-loss and the realization that I over-estimated myself, i abandonded the project. However, after requests to continue the Project I decided to rev up them fryers and start work again
